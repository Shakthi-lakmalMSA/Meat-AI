# Meat-AI - Meat Freshness Classification Using AI
 *Built with Microsoft Custom Vision & Flutter*
 
 This project leverages AI and computer vision to classify the freshness of meat (Beef) based on color features.
 
 Key Features:
 
 AI-Powered Freshness Detection: Classifies  meat freshness into categories (e.g., Fresh, Moderately Fresh, Spoiled) using image color characteristics.
 Cross-Platform Mobile App: Built with Flutter for both Android and iOS, offering real-time, user-friendly inspections.
 Offline Model Deployment: Uses TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference, even in low-connectivity environments.
 Easy to Train & Extend: New categories or meat types can be added easily with Microsoft Custom Visionâ€™s intuitive interface.
 
 Why This Project?
 Manual inspection of meat freshness can be subjective, inconsistent, and prone to error. This AI solution brings:
 
 1. Consistency in meat quality assessment
 2. Better consumer protection
 3. Reduced health risks from spoiled meat
 4. Less food waste and more efficient quality control
